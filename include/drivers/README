The files in this directory describe the devices found in GXemul's "test
machines". These machines do not match any real-world machines, but they
have devices that are similar to those found in real machines:

  o)  console (dev_cons):
	A simple console device, with putchar() and getchar()
	functionality. It also has a halt() function, to make it easy
	to exit from the emulator.

  o)  disk (dev_disk):
	Used for reading and writing 512-byte sectors from/to disk images.

  o)  ethernet (dev_ether):
	A very simple ethernet NIC, capable of sending and receiving
	ethernet frames on the simulated network.

  o)  framebuffer (dev_fb):
	Defaults to 640 x 480 pixels, 3 bytes per pixel, red-green-blue.

  o)  interrupt controller (dev_irqc):
	A generic interrupt controller. (Only for non-MIPS test machines.)

  o)  mp (dev_mp):
	A multiprocessor inter-processor communication device.
	It also contains other useful functionality, such as retrieving
	the amount of "physical" RAM installed in the emulated machine.

  o)  rtc (dev_rtc):
	A Real-Time Clock device. Used to retrieve the current time, and
	to cause periodic interrupts at a specific frequency.

Please read the GXemul documentation for more details on how to use the
testmachine devices, and study the demo programs.
